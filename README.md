Principal component analysis Program

File Structure:
readme.txt
wine_clust
Inferance_report
analysis

Development Environment:
My script was developed RStudio Version 1.3.1056

Usage:
Install RStudio. Open file in RStudio and change the code according to you dataset for various situations and run it.


File Description 
wine_clust- Script file in R language covering wine dataset scenario 
50_startups prediction - Report file which demonstrate my approach towards result for 50 start up dataset 
Inferance_report- Report file which demonstrate my approach towards result for winde dataset 
analysis- This file contains the different outcome of r function to observe the output and act accordingly on wine dataset

objective:- 
Perform Principal component analysis and perform clustering using first 
3 principal component scores (both heirarchial and k mean clustering(scree plot or elbow curve) and obtain 
optimum number of clusters and check whether we have obtained same number of clusters with the original data 
(class column we have ignored at the begining who shows it has 3 clusters)df


Note :- I have added some png files which are the different graphs on both the datasets for EDA and result observation purpose. Also added the snapshot of both the datasets.
